Overview:
Podzilla0-SVN
- Podzilla0-SVN is an SVN build of podzilla0 (also known
  as podzilla legacy or PZ0).
- Podzilla0 was the old GUI of iPodLinux before it was
  abandoned in favour of podzilla2 (for its modularity).
- Podzilla0 also has a built-in video player that can play
  uncompressed .avi files preconverted by applications
  such as MoPiD (http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/MoPiD)
- Since the iPod video (5G/5.5G) was released after the
  switch to PZ2, the PZ0 LCD driver is extremely slow with
  iPod videos to the point that PZ0 and all PZ0-based zillae
  will not "work" on iPod videos.
- The ZeroSlackr version just has a few string changes for
  ZeroSlackr Framework compatibility.
For more information, see:
- http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Podzilla_(legacy)

Usage:
- FastLaunch through "Zillae > Podzilla0-SVN".
